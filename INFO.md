# Project Information  

Information gathered during meeting on 4.9.19

<summary>Reason for project</summary>

## Problems to Solve  

1. Understand potential for different landscapes to sequester carbon as part of ongoing efforts to mitigate and build resilance against effects of climate change  

2. Simplify use of Comet-Farm by utilizing Comet-Farm API  

## Why these are problems  

1. Running meta analysis of landscape carbon sequestration is difficult due to its complexity and limited number of studies  

2. Current work flow demands too much time

<summary>Goals & Success</summary>

## Goals

1. Inform Food & Farms program strategy by understanding agriculture (not grazing) field management practices on climate outputs

2. Inform broader conversation
  - inform and improve political policy
    - rule making process parameters
    - which practices should be incentivized
  - drive Ecotrust research questions

3. Ability to do analysis of climate outputs 


## How we will be successful  

Automate Daycent model runs through Comet-Farm API

## Summary

*fields & field types*  

- 1000s of fields
- classify fields types
  - using field data
  - unsuppervised classifcation alogorithm
  - descrete categores
  - 80 - 90 categories of field types
- field type categories
  - inputs that affect soil carbon
  - same params as comet farm
  
*Comet-Farm*  

- define a set of land mgmt practices for field types
- create and export a table with parameters
   - parameters cannot be easily that varied
   
*Comet-Farm API*  

- easily run model -> vary parameters -> run model
